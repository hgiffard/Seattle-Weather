I used a publicly available data set recording Seattle, Washington's weather data over the years 1948 to 2016 to make a dashboard. Recordings were made almost every day. The dashboard I made displays the amount of rain in a given year, the number of days recorded as rainy and gives the change in rainfall to previous years and the change in the difference between the maximum and minimum temperature for each year.
